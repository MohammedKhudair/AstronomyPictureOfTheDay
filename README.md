# Astronomy Picture Of The Day

## About the Project

AstronomyPictureOfTheDay is an astronomy-themed application designed to inspire curiosity and exploration of the universe. Leveraging NASA's public Web APIs, the app delivers stunning daily images and videos of planets, galaxies, and stars, along with detailed information to fuel users’ passion for space.

This project showcases my proficiency in integrating third-party APIs, building user-friendly mobile interfaces, and handling multimedia content. 

### Key Features

- **Daily Astronomy Content:** Fetches and displays NASA’s Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD), including both images and videos.
- **Detailed Media Information:** Presents comprehensive details and descriptions for each piece of content, enhancing user engagement and learning.
- **Date-Based Browsing:** Allows users to select specific dates to explore previous images and videos, demonstrating robust date handling and dynamic API querying.
- **Intuitive User Experience:** Carefully crafted UI/UX with interactive menus and smooth navigation, reflecting strong skills in mobile interface design.

### Technologies Used

- **NASA Web APIs**: Consuming and managing real-time data from NASA’s official endpoints.
- **Mobile Development**: Building responsive, visually appealing interfaces (see screenshots below).
- **API Key Management**: Securely handling authentication for API access.

> **Note:** To access NASA’s APIs, you must register at [api.nasa.gov](https://api.nasa.gov) and obtain your personal API key.
